### CPSC 120


* Lab 3


   Lab 3, part 2 was the first program which interested me the most, due to
   the vast amount of customization that it offered.  Once our program worked
   and we tested it using my birthday as an input, seeing the correct output
   shined a light in me.  Understanding the ways a program can be constructed
   to take in any sorts of inputs and tailor a specific output, really
   motivated me at the start of this semester.


* Lab 7


   Lab 7, part 2 displayed a program that could be used for real world
   situations, which in this case was figuring out the available parking time
   of certain streets.  Using images to see the allotted time frames for
   parking led to us to think outside of the box, and use nested if statements
   for certain situations.  This program even inspired me to take a similar
   method in another personal project of mine, which checks if someone was in
   class using a given schedule.


* Lab 10


   Lab 10, part 2 was another program that I related to on the basis that I
   knew many of the counties listed in the source code, and was interested to
   see what they’re use was for.  Through the use of 2D vectors we were able
   to use many different concepts used in this course to construct the code,
   while using .at( ) and .size( ) to get specific measurements for the
   variables.  I felt as if this program was a checkpoint which tested us on
   everything we’ve learned up to this point, while also being able to be
   simplified by reading the counties and population numbers from another
   file.
